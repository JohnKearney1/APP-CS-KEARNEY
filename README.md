# App State CS Personal Projects
This repository contains the personal projects I have worked on during my time at AppState. The projects are organized by course and semester.
DO NOT: use, reproduce or otherwise replicate work in poor faith; this repository is intended to showcase my work to potential employers and collaborators.

This repository complies with the [Appalachian State University Academic Integrity Policy](https://academicintegrity.appstate.edu/). 
Code is provided as-is and is not guaranteed to be correct or complete. I do not upload files prior to the assignment due date, or during accepted submission dates.
Code that has been submitted as part of an assignment will not be uploaded to this repository until after the assignment has been graded and returned.
The code in this repository is not intended to be used as a solution to any assignment, and no assignment instructions or class materials are provided if applicable.
Code in this repository is mine and mine alone, and should not be used in any way that violates Academic Integrity Policy at Appalachian State or any other institution.
